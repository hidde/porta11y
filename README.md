# Portable Text tools

[Portable Text](https://www.sanity.io/guides/introduction-to-portable-text) is a JSON based rich text specification for modern content editing platforms. It is designed to be a format for text editing interfaces and for serializing into any human-readable format.

It provides an incredible opportunity to create editing experiences with accessibility in mind. This repository is a collection of Portable Text utilities to enrich the base editor with additional accessibility-related tools. Namely:

- [Language switcher](#language-switcher): an annotation to demark text snippets as being expressed in another language than the main content.

## Language switcher

The `lang` utility provides an annotation to demark an inline text snippet as being expressed in another language than the main content. This is important for screen-readers (WCAG 2.1 SC 3.1.2 and ATAG B.2.1.1). Refer to [this article](https://kittygiraudel.com/2022/07/25/international-content-with-sanity-portable-text/) for more information.
